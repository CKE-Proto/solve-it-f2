    "description": "Extracting volatile memory (RAM) from a powered-off system by quickly rebooting or transferring the memory module to another system before residual data fades. Cooling the memory modules can significantly slow down data decay, preserving critical data such as encryption keys or passwords.",

    "details": "",
    "subtechniques": [],
    "examples":  ["An examiner freezes a computerâ€™s RAM by spraying it with liquid nitrogen or even using inverted canned air, then powering off the live system without proper shutdown, and then booting into an external plugged USB, and try capturing the residual RAM content with encryption keys that might still be stored there."],
