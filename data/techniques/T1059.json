    "description": "Partitions are defined as ‘allocated contiguous sets of sectors from storage media’. This involves recovering the list of partitons that exist on a storage media.",
    "synonyms": ["media management analysis"],
    "details": "Partitions schemes include: MBR, GPT, APM. Some schemes such as GPT have records of the partitions in a single area (plus a backup partition table), others such as MBR make use of Extended Partitions Tables that are scattered throughout the disk.\n\nPartitions can also be deleted but may be recoverable if the start sectors of the volumes contained within them can be identified.
