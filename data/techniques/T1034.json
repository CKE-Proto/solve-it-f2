    "description": "A brute force attack, or exhaustive search is a password cracking approach where every combination of characters is tested until the correct one is found. This method is \"guaranteed to work\" given infinite time and resources which in a real-life scenario is not feasible.",
    "synonyms": ["exhaustive password search"],
    "details": "Brute force attack involves trying every possible combination in a defined search space to find the correct value. The search space could be limited to just numbers, for example in the case of a 4-digit PIN number, or alphanumerical values or even the full ASCII character set. The larger the search space, the longer it takes to complete a brute force attack.",
